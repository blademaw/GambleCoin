# GambleCoin.py

A game (or almost game) about betting and gambling coins.

## Description

Currently running on Python 2.7 with module Tkinter (not tkinter, for python3). Lots of bugs need fixing. Game is also really lacking in terms of UX and depth. Working on it...

An example of some outputted code:
```
Coinflip Result: 0
Coinflip Result: Loss
Item Effect: +25% Bonus from Loss
Total Coins without Multiplier: 45
Total Coins after Multiplier & Final: 47.25
```

## Built With

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Language Used
* [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) - Module Used for GUI
